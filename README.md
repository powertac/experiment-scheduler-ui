**This is only the web UI for the Power TAC Experiment Scheduler. Please check the main repository for more detailed instructions: https://github.com/powertac/powertac-experiment-scheduler**

Start the web ui by running the `npm run` command:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

The web UI will be reachable by default via http://localhost:9000. You can run the web UI on a different port by using the following command, where `<PORT>` represents the desired port:

```bash
$ npm run serve -- --port <PORT> --mode development
```
